                <p>All vintage items may come with flaws as all items are  pre-loved. This gives the item history and character. We hope that you will cherish and appreciate every detail in the shoes as much as we do. The colour of the product shown on pictures might vary a little compared to the actual color due to lighting. All flaws or imperfections will be in the description or/and visible on the pictures of the item.</p>
